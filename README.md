# autonomous-drone
C++ project for CSE201

On this project we will work on a AR drone  2.0.  

Persons working on this project:

Clemece Allard: clemence.allard@polytechnique.edu
Noah Sarfati: noah.sarfati@polytechnique.edu
William Koch: william.koch@polytechnique.edu
Joshua Jacob: joshua.jacob@polytechnique.edu
Yanliu Li: yanliu.li@polytechnique.edu

We want to implement features enabling the drone to be autonomous.

First we will make the drone computing the distance between him and objects that he can see.
Detecting real persons by input images.
Make the drones fight against each others.
